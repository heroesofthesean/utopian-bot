# utopian-bot
This is a bot I made for the Utopian.io Discord server. 
The idea is that the bot looks user's messages, and when the message starts with "https://steemit.com" it will delete the message, and mention the user saying "Please use Utopian.io links only!"

You should note that this is the first time I ever made a Discord bot and that I'm not an experienced coder. I'm sure there are a lot of people who could make something that looks better or neater, but I searched for a bot that could do this and didn't find any.
